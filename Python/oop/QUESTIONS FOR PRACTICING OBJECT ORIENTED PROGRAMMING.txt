Practicing object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python can be fun and rewarding! Here are a few problems to get you started:


1. Beginner Level

    a. Create a Person class:
        Attributes: name, age, gender
        Methods: introduce(), birthday()

    b. Design a BankAccount class:
        Attributes: account_number, balance, owner_name
        Methods: deposit(), withdraw(), check_balance()

    c. Model a Car class:
        Attributes: make, model, year, speed
        Methods: accelerate(), brake(), get_speed()


2. Intermediate Level:

    a. Implement a Library system:
        Classes: Book, Member, Library
        Functionality: Add/remove books, borrow/return books, search for books, etc.

    b. Build a basic Shape hierarchy:
        Base class: Shape (abstract)
        Subclasses: Circle, Rectangle, Triangle
        Methods: area(), perimeter() (abstract in base class)

    c. Create a simple Inventory management system:
        Classes: Product, Inventory
        Functionality: Add/remove products, update stock, display low-stock items, etc.


3. Advanced Level:

    a. Develop a Game of your choice (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Blackjack):
        Use OOP principles to model the game elements (players, board, cards, etc.)
        Implement game logic and user interactions.

    b. Design a Restaurant ordering system:
        Classes: Menu, MenuItem, Order, Customer, etc.
        Functionality: Display menu, take orders, calculate bills, manage tables, etc.

    c. Build a Social Media platform (simplified):
        Classes: User, Post, Comment, etc.
        Functionality: Create/delete accounts, post/delete content, follow/unfollow users, etc.
