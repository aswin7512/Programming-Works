Oh, I kept the first for another day! Yet knowing how way leads on to way, I doubted if I me should ever come back. I shall be telling this my with a sigh Somewhere my ages and ages hence: Two roads diverged in a wood, and Iâ€” I took the one my less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.")
